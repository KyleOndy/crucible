# Crucible Project Guidelines

## Task Management with core/TASKS.md

### Core Principles

- **Always check core/TASKS.md first** before starting any development work
- **Update TASKS.md immediately** when tasks are completed or new ones
  identified
- **Use the TodoWrite tool for session tracking** but maintain TASKS.md for
  long-term planning
- **Keep tasks specific and actionable** with clear acceptance criteria

### Workflow Integration

1. **Before starting work**: Read core/TASKS.md to understand current priorities
2. **During development**: Use TodoWrite for session-level task tracking
3. **After completing work**: Update core/TASKS.md with completed tasks and any new
   discoveries
4. **Weekly review**: Move completed tasks to dated sections, reprioritize
   remaining work

### Task Formatting Standards

- Use checkbox format: `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete
- Include complexity estimates: S (Small), M (Medium), L (Large)
- Add context and acceptance criteria for non-trivial tasks
- Group related tasks under clear headings
- Archive completed tasks with dates for historical reference

### Priority Guidelines

- **High**: Critical bugs, security issues, blocking dependencies
- **Medium**: Important features, performance improvements, refactoring
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, documentation, cleanup tasks

### When to Update core/TASKS.md

- ✅ When starting a new development session
- ✅ When completing any task
- ✅ When discovering new work during implementation
- ✅ When priorities change based on user feedback
- ✅ When architecture decisions impact future work
