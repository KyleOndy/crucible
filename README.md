# Crucible

The AI powered evolution of `foundry` - an SRE productivity system built with Babashka.

## Purpose

Crucible is an AI-powered SRE productivity system that streamlines daily operations through intelligent logging, ticket management, and documentation synchronization.

## Project Organization

Crucible uses a unified development approach with a single `bb.edn` file that serves two purposes:

### 1. Development Tasks

- `bb nrepl` - Start nREPL server for MCP integration
- `bb dev` - Start development environment
- `bb clean` - Clean REPL artifacts

### 2. User-Facing Commands

- `bb crucible <command>` - Main CLI dispatcher
- `bb l` - Convenience alias for daily log
- `bb pipe` - Convenience alias for piping stdin to logs
- `bb work-on <ticket>` - Convenience alias for ticket workflow

## Architecture

```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TASKS.md        # Implementation roadmap
â””â”€â”€ workspace/          # User data (gitignored)
    â”œâ”€â”€ logs/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tickets/
    â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

## Distribution Strategy

Crucible follows a progressive distribution approach:

1. **Development Phase**: `bb crucible <command>`
2. **Convenience Phase**: Shell aliases (`alias c='bb crucible'`)
3. **Binary Phase**: Compile to native binary with GraalVM
4. **Distribution Phase**: Install as standalone `c` or `crucible` binary

This approach allows seamless development while providing an optimal end-user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) installed
- Java 11+ (for development dependencies)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Check your setup status (before alias exists)
bb crucible setup-check

# 2. Set up the 'c' alias for convenience
alias c='bb crucible'
# Add to your shell config file for persistence

# 3. Verify setup (now using the alias!)
c setup-check

# 4. Start using Crucible
c help

# 5. Set up Jira integration (optional)
c jira-check  # Test your Jira configuration
```

For detailed setup instructions including shell-specific configurations, see [docs/setup-guide.md](docs/setup-guide.md).
For Jira integration setup and usage, see [docs/jira-guide.md](docs/jira-guide.md).

### Development Setup

```bash
# Start development environment with nREPL
bb dev

# View available commands
c help  # or 'bb crucible help' before alias setup

# Test basic functionality
c log daily
c work-on TEST-123
```

### Command Output Logging

Crucible includes a powerful pipe functionality for capturing command outputs in your daily logs.
It works like an enhanced `tee` - logging to your daily log while passing output through to the next command:

```bash
# Basic piping (no command logged)
kubectl get pods | bb pipe

# With command logging
kubectl get pods | bb pipe "kubectl get pods"

# Tee-like behavior - logs AND continues pipeline
kubectl get pods | bb pipe "kubectl get pods" | grep Running | wc -l

# Automatic command logging with cpipe wrapper
cpipe() { eval "$*" | bb pipe "$*"; }
cpipe "kubectl get pods | grep Running"
```

The `cpipe` function automatically executes commands and logs both the command and output to your daily log.
See `docs/cpipe-setup.md` for detailed setup instructions for bash, zsh, and fish shells.

### Jira Integration

Crucible includes powerful Jira integration for streamlined ticket management:

```bash
# Test your Jira configuration
c jira-check
c jira-check PROJ-1234  # Test with a specific ticket

# Create quick tickets
c qs "Fix authentication timeout"
c quick-story "Implement user dashboard"
```

**Key Features:**
- **Configuration Testing**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- **Quick Ticket Creation**: Create tickets with minimal input
- **Auto-Assignment**: Automatically assign new tickets to yourself
- **Sprint Integration**: Add tickets to current active sprint
- **Secure Authentication**: Support for pass password manager integration

For complete setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting, see [docs/jira-guide.md](docs/jira-guide.md).

ðŸš§ **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (In Progress)

- [x] Enhanced logging system with pipe functionality
- [x] Daily log management with template system
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Basic command implementations

ðŸ“‹ **Upcoming**: Ticket management, documentation sync

See `core/TASKS.md` for detailed implementation roadmap.

## Key Design Decisions

### Single bb.edn Approach

After evaluating multiple approaches, we chose a unified `bb.edn` structure because:

- Maintains all project concerns in one place
- Clear separation between development and user tasks
- Natural progression from script to binary distribution
- Follows babashka ecosystem patterns
- Simplifies MCP integration for development

### Progressive Distribution

Rather than immediately creating a binary, Crucible starts as babashka scripts and graduates to native binaries. This approach:

- Enables rapid development iteration
- Provides flexibility during feature development
- Allows testing of the full user workflow early
- Supports seamless transition to production distribution

## Future Ideas

### End-of-Day Workflow Enhancement

Building on the successful start-day functionality (`bb sd`), planned end-day features:

**`bb ed` (End Day) Command:**
- Interactive end-of-day summary editor
- Task completion review and status updates
- Automatic carry-forward of uncompleted tasks to tomorrow
- Standup notes generation from today's activities
- Optional cleanup of old drafts and command outputs

### Jira Integration Evolution

**Current State:** Manual copy/paste from daily logs to Jira as needed

**Future Vision:** Intelligent Jira workflow integration
- Optional work log creation from daily log task sections
- Smart ticket status updates based on log content
- Automatic time tracking integration
- Context-aware ticket commenting from log summaries

**Design Philosophy:** Maintain user control - never automatically push to Jira without explicit confirmation

### Confluence Backup Integration

**Planned Features:**
- Automatic daily log archival to personal Confluence space
- Smart detection of unarchived logs during start-day routine
- Markdown to Confluence format conversion
- Searchable historical log repository
- Privacy controls for sensitive command outputs

**Benefits:**
- Searchable work history across all devices
- Team visibility into daily activities when appropriate
- Backup protection against local data loss
- Integration with existing Atlassian ecosystem

### Advanced Context Intelligence

**On-Call Awareness:**
- Dual context merging: recent activity + last regular work day
- Intelligent work type detection (regular vs. incident response)
- Flexible time gap handling for holidays and PTO
- Enhanced sprint and ticket context from extended breaks

**Smart Integrations:**
- Calendar integration for meeting context
- 1:1 document linking and reminders
- Team standup preparation automation
- Cross-team visibility for shared work items

### Implementation Approach

All future features will follow the established patterns:
- **Incremental Enhancement:** Build on existing daily log workflow
- **Single Editor Path:** Maintain `bb l` as primary editing interface
- **User Choice:** All automations require explicit user confirmation
- **Graceful Degradation:** Features work without external dependencies
- **Privacy First:** User controls what information gets shared where
