# Quick Commit Command

Create focused, efficient commits for small changes while maintaining quality standards. Perfect for bug fixes, minor improvements, and rapid iteration cycles.

## When to Use Quick Commit

### Ideal Scenarios

- **Bug fixes**: Single-issue corrections
- **Minor improvements**: Small optimizations or cleanup
- **Documentation updates**: README, comments, or docstring changes
- **Configuration tweaks**: Small config or setting adjustments
- **Rapid iteration**: Quick changes during development cycles
- **Single-function changes**: Focused modifications to one function

### Use Regular `/commit-work` Instead For

- **Multiple related changes**: Complex features spanning multiple files
- **Signature refactoring**: Major structural changes
- **New features**: Substantial functionality additions
- **Breaking changes**: Modifications that affect existing interfaces

## Workflow

### 1. Quick Change Assessment

Verify the scope is appropriate for quick commit:

```bash
# Check what changed
git status

# Review the actual changes
git diff

# Ensure changes are focused and small (< 50 lines typically)
git diff --stat
```

### 2. Focused Validation

Run targeted checks appropriate to the change:

```bash
# For Clojure changes - syntax check
clj-kondo --lint core/

# For format-sensitive changes
cljstyle check

# For functional changes - quick test
bb [relevant-command-to-test]

# For config changes - validate config loads
bb test-config.clj
```

### 3. TodoWrite Quick Update

Update session tracking without heavy analysis:

```markdown
# Simple TodoWrite update:
1. Mark current task as completed if applicable
2. Note what was fixed/improved
3. Keep tracking minimal for quick changes
```

### 4. Streamlined Commit Creation

Generate focused commit message:

```bash
# Stage the changes
git add [specific-files-or-all]

# Create commit with concise but clear message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Type]: [Brief description]

[Optional: 1-2 line explanation if context needed]

)"
```

### 5. Quick Verification

Basic verification appropriate to change scope:

```bash
# Verify commit was created
git log -1 --oneline

# Quick functional test if applicable
bb [test-command]

# Check git status is clean
git status
```

## Commit Message Format

### Standard Types

- **Fix**: Bug corrections
- **Improve**: Performance or usability enhancements  
- **Refactor**: Code structure improvements (no behavior change)
- **Update**: Documentation, comments, or configuration
- **Add**: Small feature additions
- **Remove**: Cleanup or deletion

### Examples

```bash
# Bug fix
Fix: Handle null values in ticket-id parsing

# Performance improvement  
Improve: Cache compiled regex patterns in adf.clj

# Code cleanup
Refactor: Extract duplicate string validation logic

# Documentation
Update: Add docstring for parse-inline-formatting

# Configuration
Update: Increase Jira API timeout to 30 seconds

# Small feature
Add: Support for basic markdown in log entries
```

## Validation Levels

### Minimal Validation (for safe changes)

- Syntax check with clj-kondo
- Git status verification
- **Use for**: Documentation, comments, simple bug fixes

### Standard Validation (most changes)

- Syntax and style checks
- Basic functional test with bb command
- **Use for**: Logic changes, new small functions

### Enhanced Validation (risky changes)

- Full test suite if available
- Cross-platform considerations
- **Use for**: Changes affecting core workflows

## Integration with TASKS.md

### Task Completion

```markdown
# If change completes a task:
- Change [ ] to [x] in TASKS.md
- Include TASKS.md in the commit

# If change partially completes a task:
- Add progress note but keep task open
- Mention progress in commit message
```

### Task Discovery

```markdown
# If change reveals new tasks:
- Add new tasks to TASKS.md
- Note task additions in commit message
- Consider if new tasks should block current work
```

## Quick Commit vs Regular Commit Decision Tree

```
Change affects multiple files? â†’ Regular Commit
Change modifies function signatures? â†’ Regular Commit
Change requires extensive testing? â†’ Regular Commit
Change is < 50 lines and focused? â†’ Quick Commit
Change is bug fix or improvement? â†’ Quick Commit
Change is documentation only? â†’ Quick Commit
Unsure about scope? â†’ Quick Commit (safer to be minimal)
```

## Common Quick Commit Scenarios

### Bug Fix Flow

1. Identify and fix bug
2. `git diff` to verify fix is focused
3. `clj-kondo --lint core/` for syntax
4. `bb [test-command]` for function test
5. `git add -A && /quick-commit`

### Documentation Update Flow

1. Update documentation/comments
2. `git diff` to review changes
3. `markdownlint-cli2` if markdown files changed
4. `git add -A && /quick-commit`

### Configuration Tweak Flow

1. Modify configuration
2. `bb test-config.clj` to validate
3. Test relevant functionality
4. `git add -A && /quick-commit`

## Error Handling

### If Validation Fails

1. **Fix the issue** before committing
2. **Re-run validation** to ensure fix works
3. **Consider scope expansion** - might need regular commit

### If Change Scope Grows

1. **Stop quick commit process**
2. **Use `/commit-work`** for comprehensive approach
3. **Document expanded scope** in regular commit

### If Unsure About Impact

1. **Default to `/commit-work`** for safety
2. **Get more context** with `/check-last-commit` after
3. **Learn for future** quick vs regular decisions

## Integration with Development Cycle

### Linux Development

- Primary use case for quick commits
- Full tooling available for validation
- Fast iteration cycles

### Mac Testing Preparation

- Ensure quick commits are complete and tested
- Batch multiple quick commits before Mac sync
- Test accumulated changes on Mac

### Session Flow

```
/start-work â†’ [work] â†’ /quick-commit â†’ [more work] â†’ /quick-commit â†’ /commit-work
```

## Expected Output

```bash
# Quick commit execution example:

$ /quick-commit

Analyzing changes...
Files changed: 1 (core/jira.clj)
Lines changed: +3 -1

Running validation...
âœ… clj-kondo: No issues found
âœ… cljstyle: Format correct
âœ… Basic test: bb crucible log daily (success)

Creating commit...
[more-ai 1a2b3c4] Fix: Handle empty sprint names in jira integration

Changes committed successfully.

Next: Continue work or use /quick-check for verification
```

This command enables rapid, quality-focused iteration while maintaining the project's high standards for commit quality and traceability.
