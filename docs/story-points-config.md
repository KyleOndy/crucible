# Setting Default Field Values (Story Points & Fix Versions)

You can configure Crucible to automatically set story points and fix versions when creating tickets using the `qs` command.

## Configuration

Add these settings to your `.crucible.edn` file:

```clojure
{:jira {:default-story-points 3
        :story-points-field "customfield_10002"
        :default-fix-version-id "10100"}}
```

## Finding Your Story Points Field ID

Story points are stored in a custom field. To find the correct field ID for your Jira instance:

### Method 1: Use Crucible's field discovery

```bash
# This will show you available fields and their IDs
bb -cp core -e "(require '[lib.jira :as j] '[lib.config :as c])
                (let [config (c/load-config)]
                  (j/get-create-metadata (:jira config) \"YOUR-PROJECT\" \"Story\"))"
```

Look for fields with names like "Story Points", "Story Point Estimate", or similar.

### Method 2: Check an existing story ticket

1. Open any Story ticket in your browser
2. Look at the URL - it should be like `https://your-jira.com/browse/PROJ-123`
3. Change the URL to `https://your-jira.com/rest/api/2/issue/PROJ-123`
4. Look for fields starting with `customfield_` that contain numeric values
5. The story points field typically has a name like "Story Points" or "Story Point Estimate"

### Method 3: Common field IDs

Story points are commonly found in these custom fields:
- `customfield_10002`
- `customfield_10004`
- `customfield_10008`
- `customfield_10016`

You can try each one until you find the right field for your instance.

## Finding Your Fix Version ID

Fix versions use standard Jira version IDs. To find the correct ID for your project:

### Method 1: Use Crucible's field discovery

```bash
# Get project versions and their IDs
bb -cp core -e "(require '[lib.jira :as j] '[lib.config :as c])
                (let [config (c/load-config)
                      response (j/jira-request (:jira config) :get \"/project/YOUR-PROJECT/versions\")]
                  (:body response))"
```

This will show all versions for your project with their IDs and names.

### Method 2: Check an existing ticket with fix version

1. Open a ticket that has a fix version set
2. Change the URL to `https://your-jira.com/rest/api/2/issue/PROJ-123`
3. Look for the `fixVersions` field - it will show the ID and name:
   ```json
   "fixVersions": [{"id": "10100", "name": "2.1.0"}]
   ```

### Method 3: Using the browser network tab

1. Open your project's "Versions" page in Jira
2. Open browser developer tools (F12) â†’ Network tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for API calls to `/version` endpoints
5. The response will show version IDs and names

## Example Configuration

```clojure
;; Example .crucible.edn
{:jira {:base-url "https://your-company.atlassian.net"
        :username "your.email@company.com"
        :api-token "pass:jira/api-token"
        :default-project "PROJ"
        :default-issue-type "Story"
        :default-story-points 5      ; Default story points for new tickets
        :story-points-field "customfield_10002"  ; Your story points field ID
        :default-fix-version-id "10100"          ; Default fix version ID
        :auto-assign-self true
        :auto-add-to-sprint true}}
```

## How It Works

When you create a ticket with `c qs "My story"`, Crucible will:

1. Create the ticket with your title and description
2. If `default-story-points` is set AND `story-points-field` is configured:
   - Add the default story points to the ticket
   - Only if story points aren't already specified in `custom-fields`
3. If `default-fix-version-id` is configured:
   - Add the fix version to the ticket
   - This is a standard Jira field, not a custom field
4. Apply any other configured custom fields

## Alternative: Using Custom Fields Directly

You can also set story points (and override the default) using the custom fields configuration:

```clojure
{:jira {:custom-fields {"customfield_10002" 8}}}  ; Always use 8 story points
```

The `custom-fields` approach takes precedence over `default-story-points`.

**Note**: Fix versions cannot be overridden through custom fields since it's a standard Jira field. If you need different fix versions per ticket, omit `default-fix-version-id` from your config and set them manually.

## Validation

To test your configuration:

```bash
# Dry run to see what would be created
c qs "Test story" --dry-run

# This will show you the story points and fix version values that would be set
```

If story points and fix versions appear in the dry run output, your configuration is working correctly.

## Key Differences: Story Points vs Fix Versions

| Aspect | Story Points | Fix Versions |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Field Type** | Custom field | Standard Jira field |
| **Configuration** | Requires field ID + value | Just the version ID |
| **Location in API** | `customfield_XXXXX` | `fixVersions` |
| **Override Method** | Via `custom-fields` config | Cannot override (omit from config instead) |
| **Value Format** | Number (e.g., `5`) | Version ID string (e.g., `"10100"`) |
| **Multiple Values** | Single value | Supports multiple (but config sets one) |

Both features work together and can be used simultaneously.
